This PubMed query aims to find observational studies that use real-world healthcare data, 
specifically data from administrative claims and electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR).  
The search prioritizes studies from various international databases that describe their methods for identifying patient cohorts 
and defining health conditions or outcomes (including the use of phenotyping algorithms and ICD coding). 
It is constructed to exclude clinical trials, genetic studies, and other publication types not focused on observational research using routinely collected healthcare data. 
It includes search terms for validation.
