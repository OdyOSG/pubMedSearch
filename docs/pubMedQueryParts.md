Let's break the query down into its four major parts, 
which are connected by Boolean operators **AND** and **NOT**. 
Essentially, PubMed will return only those articles that satisfy all of the following:

---

## 1. Must indicate some form of an observational or retrospective study

```
(("Observational Study"[Publication Type]) 
 OR ("Retrospective Studies"[Mesh]) 
 OR (observational[tiab]) 
 OR (retrospective[tiab]) 
 OR ("retrospective analysis"[tiab]) 
 OR ("retrospective analyses"[tiab]) 
 OR ("retrospective review"[tiab]) 
 OR ("retrospective study"[tiab]) 
 OR ("case-control"[tiab]) 
 OR ("case control"[tiab]) 
 OR ("cohort study"[tiab]) 
 OR ("cohort analysis"[tiab]) 
 OR ("chart review"[tiab]) 
 OR ("medical record review"[tiab]) 
 OR ("record review"[tiab]) 
 OR ("database study"[tiab]) 
 OR ("non-interventional"[tiab]) 
 OR ("non interventional"[tiab]) 
 OR ("nonrandomized"[tiab]) 
 OR ("non randomized"[tiab]) 
 OR ("historical cohort"[tiab]) 
 OR ("archival data"[tiab]) 
 OR ("longitudinal study"[tiab]) 
 OR ("comparative effectiveness research"[tiab]) 
 OR ("real world data"[tiab]) 
 OR ("real-world data"[tiab]) 
 OR ("real world evidence"[tiab]) 
 OR ("real-world evidence"[tiab]))
```

All those terms describe articles that are likely **observational**â€”including retrospective study designs, case-control, cohort, chart review, database study, and so on.

---

## 2. Must involve real-world data sources like claims, registries, EHR

```
AND (("claims data") 
     OR ("claims analysis") 
     OR ("claims database") 
     OR ("administrative data") 
     OR ("registry study") 
     OR ("registry analysis") 
     OR ("registry data") 
     OR ("real-world") 
     OR ("real world") 
     OR ("real-world evidence") 
     OR ("secondary data analysis") 
     OR ("electronic health record") 
     OR (EMR) 
     OR (EHR) 
     OR ("insurance claims") 
     OR ("administrative claims data") 
     OR ("health care data") 
     OR ("healthcare data"))
```

This part ensures the article specifically refers to a real-world data environment: claims databases, electronic health records (EHR/EMR), registry data, etc.

---

## 3. Must mention large population-level data sources / databases

```
AND ((SEER) 
     OR (NHANES) 
     OR (Medicare) 
     OR (Medicaid) 
     OR ("VA data") 
     OR ("Veterans Affairs") 
     OR (Sentinel) 
     OR (HCUP) 
     OR (NSQIP) 
     OR (Denmark/epidemiology[Mesh]) 
     OR (National Health Insurance Research[Mesh]) 
     OR ("General Practice Research Database") 
     OR ("Clinical Practice Research Datalink") 
     OR ("The Health Improvement Network") 
     OR ("Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database") 
     OR ("Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service") 
     OR (BIFAP) 
     OR (SIDIAP) 
     OR (QResearch) 
     OR (Truven) 
     OR (Merativ) 
     OR (Optum) 
     OR (Medstat) 
     OR (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) 
     OR (PharMetrics) 
     OR (PHARMO) 
     OR (IMS) 
     OR (IQVIA) 
     OR ("Premier database"))
```

All of these are well-known sources or databases used in observational research (e.g., SEER, NHANES, Medicare, Medicaid, VA data, HCUP, major European databases, IQVIA, Optum, etc.).

---

## 4. Must **exclude** (i.e., NOT) clinical trials, prospective designs, case reports, systematic reviews, editorials, pilot studies, genetics, etc.

```
AND NOT (("Clinical Trial"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Randomized Controlled Trial"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Controlled Clinical Trial"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Prospective Studies"[Mesh]) 
         OR ("Case Reports"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Systematic Review"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Meta-Analysis"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Editorial"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Letter"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("Comment"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("News"[Publication Type]) 
         OR ("pilot study"[tiab]) 
         OR ("pilot projects"[Mesh]) 
         OR ("double-blind"[tiab]) 
         OR ("placebo-controlled"[tiab]) 
         OR ("Genetics"[Mesh]) 
         OR ("Genotype"[Mesh]) 
         OR ("biomarker"[tiab]))
```

This final block removes articles that are explicitly clinical trials, prospective trials, systematic reviews, editorials, or otherwise not relevant to purely observational/retrospective secondary data analyses.

---

## Putting It All Together

In plain language, the query does this:

1. **Find articles** that indicate an observational or retrospective design.
2. **AND** that mention real-world data sources (e.g., claims, registries, EHR).
3. **AND** that also reference major population databases (SEER, NHANES, Medicare, etc.).
4. **AND** **exclude** any that are prospective trials, case reports, systematic reviews, editorials, etc.

Effectively, it is a well-structured PubMed query for identifying **observational, retrospective, real-world data studies** using well-known databases, while excluding clinical trials and other article types that are not relevant to that purpose.
